# PROBLEM STATEMENT:
   - AA: SUMMARY
     - Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:
         1. Total Loan Applications: We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. 
            Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications.
         2. Total Funded Amount: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We also want to keep an 
            eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount metric.
         3. Total Amount Received: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow 
            and loan repayment. We should analyse the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Receive.
         4. Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans which will provide insights into our lending 
            portfolio's overall cost.
         5. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health. 
            We need to compute the average DTI for all loans.

         4. Bad Loan Total Received Amount

   - AB: OVERVIEW
    - CHARTS
         1. Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line/ Area Chart):  To identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities
         2. Regional Analysis by State (Bar Chart): To identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional 
            disparities

            lengths.
         4. Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart): How lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different 
            employment lengths, helping us assess the impact of employment history on loan applications.

            of loans, aiding in the understanding of the primary reasons borrowers seek financing.
         6. Home Ownership Analysis (Tree/ Heat Map): For a hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan
